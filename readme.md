## Installation and Setup

To run the projects in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shimul-Zahan/ML-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ML_Projects
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

Each project folder contains:

- A `README.md` file explaining the project.
- The project code.
- A sample dataset (or a link to a dataset).

Simply follow the instructions in the project-specific `README.md` to run and explore the project.
